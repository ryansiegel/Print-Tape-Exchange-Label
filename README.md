# Print-Tape-Exchange-Label
This project was created to replace an existing program at my job that was being done manually. The program created a label to be printed off of the tapes going off site. Everything from day, monthly tapes, week, etc had to manually be entered. With this script, the script determines what needs to be printed based on the date and then prints it off at 11am via task scheduler on the desktop. Besides saving minutes per day long term, the biggest issue of why this was also created was that the previous program needed to be updated due to certain tapes being no longer needed. With this script, it should be adjustable depending on what is needed.
